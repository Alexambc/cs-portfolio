### Dear Future CS Students,
This could be the worst or best class you take, for me it was the best. It allowed me to explore my creativity and more importantly, helped me develop the skill of coding, which is a great skill to have in life since everything is technology now. What I wish I knew from the start is that it’s okay not to understand everything right away. Google your errors, everything is online and everyone uses Google, even Ms. Portocarrero. Make sure you start your projects early. Even if you get a week to finish it, you can get stuck for days on the same problem. The most surprising thing about CS is that your biggest error could be a simple spelling mistake, and it’ll mess up your whole code and take you hours to figure out. The mindset that helped me succeed was being patient and not giving up.
