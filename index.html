      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>After graduation, I plan to go to college and follow a pre-med track, I know, Surprisingly, it’s not related to computer science, but that could change.</p>
      <p>I chose CS because after my freshman year, I discovered that I really enjoyed coding. It challenged me, and it let me be creative in ways I didn’t expect.</p>
